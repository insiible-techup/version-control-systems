# Benefits of version control

## Managing and Protecting the Source Code

The Version Control System helps manage the source code for the software team by keeping track of all the code modifications.
It also protects the source code from any unintended human error and consequences.

## Keeping Track of All the Modifications Made to the Code

The team working on the project continuously produces new source codes and keeps making amendments to the existing code.
These changes are recorded for future references and can be used if ever needed in the future to discover the root cause of any particular problem.

## Collaboration

Version control helps to promote the collaboration of multiple people or teams on the same code base

## Comparing Earlier Versions of the Code

Since all the versions of the code are saved, this makes it possible for developers to go back at any time
and compare the earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while reducing disruption to all team members.

## Backup

Version control system servers as a form of backup for your source code
