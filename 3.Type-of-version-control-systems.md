# Type of version control systems

The two most common types of version control systems are centralized and distributed.

## Centralized version control system

In a centralized version control system (CVCS), one single server stores all of the versions and changes to all files.
With this type of version control, users create a separate branch of the project, work on it alone, and merge it back into the main branch.
All changes — all commits and merges — are synced to the central server.

One of the main benefits of a centralized VCS is that every user has quick access to the latest version of a file.

## Distributed version control system

In a distributed version control system (DVCS),each user downloads a copy of the repository so they can make changes to files locally (on their own machine).

It is also allows users to work offline.
