# Why use version control

Version control is important for keeping track of changes to code, files, and other digital assets.
It should help you develop and ship products faster.
This is especially important for DevOps workflows where delivery of the latest versions can be tested or built during submission of the change.

Using the right version control software:

* Improves visibility.
* Minimizes file conflicts and wasted effort.
* Helps teams collaborate around the world.
* Accelerates product delivery.
